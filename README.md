# Capstone App

This is my last project for the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.

This app uses 3 APIs to show the user the weather forecast during their trip and also a picture of their desired destination after submitting the form.

It contains the following features:

1. It's been built with the package bundler Webpack
1. There is a development and a production mode with different configurations
1. Babel is used to make the app compatible with older versions of Javascript
1. The server is build with Node and it contains a route for making the API calls
1. The API calls are made through Fetch and the keys are hidden in a .env file for security

The app is also responsive and uses SASS for the UI styling.
